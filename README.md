This Flutter application introduce you with different types of flutter 
widgets, packages, layouts, designs, animations, local storage, push 
notifications, network operations, maps & locations, livestreaming, 
method channel, state management and more.
</p>
<p>
Here I will try my best to implement the best practices mand try to 
improve the readability maintainability and performance. Here I 
will provide some details information with images.

<h3>Flutter Widget Catalog</h3>
<hr>
<p id="flutter_widget_catalog">
Create beautiful apps faster with Flutter’s collection of visual, 
structural, platform, and interactive widgets. In addition to browsing 
widgets by category, you can also see all the widgets in the 
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/widgets">widget index</a>.

<h3>Flutter Complex Widget</h3>
<hr>
<p id="flutter_complex_widget">
Flutter provides a great set of basic Material and Cupertino widgets — 
but maybe you want something a little different. A novel UI can give 
a user a far richer experience.

Here I create some complex widget using flutter widget based on requirement.

<h3>Flutter Layouts</h3>
<hr>
<p id="flutter_layouts">
The core of Flutter’s layout mechanism is widgets. In Flutter, almost 
everything is a widget — even layout models are widgets. The images, 
icons, and text that you see in a Flutter app are all widgets. But 
things you don’t see are also widgets, such as the rows, columns, and 
grids that arrange, constrain, and align the visible widgets.

You create a layout by composing widgets to build more complex widgets.

<h3>Local Storage</h3>
<hr>
<p id="local_storage">
Sometimes there are just some things that need to be stored 
locally in our app.

Here I implement <b>Shared Preferences</b>,<b>SQLite</b>,<b>Hive</b>
and <b>File</b>,

</p>

<h3>Firebase</h3>
<hr>
<p id="firebase">
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform 
that provides hosted backend services such as a realtime database, 
cloud storage, authentication, crash reporting, machine learning, 
remote configuration, and hosting for your static files.

Firebase supports Flutter. Here I will use firebase and complete some operations

</p>

<h3>Map Details</h3>
<hr>
<p id="map_details">
For mobile application development Map (google, osm, huawei), implement 
map is very important. By implementing different types of map we can 
creates user friendly applications. Here I implement <b>Google</b>, 
<b>OSM</b>, and <b>Huawei</b> maps
</p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>
<hr>
<p id="notifications">
Push notifications are great for driving user engagement and notifying 
users for updates. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free (yes, zero 
cost!) cross-platform messaging solution provided by Google. It allows 
you to send notifications to a customised group of users on a variety 
of platforms easily.

Here I implement the push notification and send notification to my app from server
